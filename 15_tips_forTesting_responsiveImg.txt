Quick tips for Experimenting with Responsive Images.

First Tip:
==========

1. Let's use the 'large-hero' image as an example
2. And we're testing the responsiveness of our images while shrinking the size of the window
3. We can see that it's not very difficult to see when the image Snaps to a new image
4. But some other time it is not so clear
5. The issue here is that you want to know exactly what picture you're looking at
6. So that's why in our images/folder, we can see that, for each image there's a matching one ending with -i
7. The -i stands for "information", so you can create copies and see when an image is being Used
8. So in our 'index.html' file, we can edit our images and use those with '-i' ending like this
9. <source srcset="assets/images/hero--large-i.jpg 1920w, assets/images/hero--large-hi-dpi.jpg 3840w" media="(min-width: 1380px)">
10 Back in the browser, let's test it
11 Now we can see the '-i' images with their width and a light black overlay
12 Right now it is perfectly clear when images are swapping back and forth


Second Tip:
===========

1. Simulating and Testing different pixel densities
2. In our browser we can see that we're using the large crop (1920px wide x 654px tall)
3. Which matching with what we have in our HTML file
4. But remember that we also included a 'hi-dpi' version of (3840px)
5. Depending on the monitor but the browser is intelligent enough to not Use that version
6. But as a developer you want to see all Images in Action
7. So How can we test and see those 'hi-dpi' images in our browser?
8. Well Google chrome has amazing Developer tools
9. In Chrome we can right click and chose 'Inspect'
10 That will open the Developer tools window
11 Click on the Top left corner the 'togle device mode' icon
12 On the Top of the window we can see a few options
13 Chrome can EMULATE different devices like Galaxy S5, or iPhone 6, etc...
14 In our situation what we want to do is set it to 'Responsive'
15 Remember that our goal is to Simulate different size densities
16 To do that click on those 3 dots in the Top Right corner
17 And select 'show device pixel ratio'
18 A new option appears on the screen named 'DPR 1.0' that stands for 'Device Pixel Ratio'
19 Let's jump in our HTML file and make sure for instance that both of our Large crops are using the '-i' versions
20 Then Save our file
21 By default we're using a 'DPR 1.0', so let's simulate a screen that has a higher pixel density 'DPR 2.0'
22 And Refresh the page, the browser should realize that the image that is needed is Double Size now
23 We are also reassured that we didn't include a typo in our 'hi-dpi' file for instance
24 So Chrome can help us Testing devices with different characteristics.
25 Now we can remove those '-i'
