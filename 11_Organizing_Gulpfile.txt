Overview
*********
In order to stay organize with our code, we're going to break up this gulp file into several smaller
highly focussed files.

So what should we do First?
===========================
Let's make our first job to pull out any of the code in this file that is responsible
for our CSS Tasks.
And then let's move that code into its own separate file.

1. In the root of our Project file folder
2. Let's create a brand new Folder named gulp
3. Whithin that 'gulp' folder let's create a new folder named 'tasks'
4. Whithin that 'tasks' folder let's create a new file named 'styles.js'
5. Back in our 'gulpfile', let's move our 'styles tasks' out of that main file
6. And paste it into our new dedicated 'styles.js' file
7. Now we need to make sure that any of the variables used in that code are 
   defined at the Top of this 'styles.js' File
8. So if we take a close look, 'styles.js' file needs to know what are:
	-gulp
	-postcss
	-autoprefixer
	-cssvars
	-nested
	and 
	-cssImport

9. From the main file we can remove all those variables that deal with 'postcss'
10 From the time being 'styles.js' file is complete.
11 From that same 'tasks' folder let's create a new folder named 'watch.js'
12 Now we are going to do the same, meaning move every single 'watch task' inside
   our brand new 'watch.js' file.
13 So back in our main 'gulpfile.js', let's cut the entire 'gulp watch task' and 
   paste it in 'watch.js'
14 And let's also grab the 'cssInject task'
15 We need to make sure to copy the variables used for:
	-gulp
	-gulp-watch
16 Back in our main 'gulpfile.js' file, let's see what's left:
	-we have 2 dummy tasks that we don't really need 
	 anymore, but we can leave them as is or delete them
	-And we need to cut as well the 'browserSync' variable into our 'watch.js' file

17 Back in our main 'gulpfile.js' file, there shouldn't be any code left in that file
   We don't even need to know what:
   	-var gulp = require('gulp') is
   	or what
   	-watch = require('gulp-watch') is;
   So now we have a completely EMPTY 'gulpfile.js' file

18 But it won't stay empty that long, because we want to import the dedicated
   'tasks' file that we just created
19 So let's first import the 'styles.js' file with require() function; No extension NEEDED
	require('./gulp/tasks/styles');

  Then let's import our 'watch.js' file as well with require() function
  	require('./gulp/tasks/watch');

20 Now from the cmd line, let's take our 'gulp watch' for a Spin, type in:

	~ gulp watch

   And it should work like a Charm.
