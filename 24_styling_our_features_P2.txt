We dive in from where we left off, enhancing 'Our features' layout for small screens. 
The next adjustments that we should make for small screens is , to let the <p> content uses it full available width, and stacks the corresponding Icon above it.
So to make that change, let's jump over our '_feature-item' CSS file , and modify that 'padding-left: 94px' applied to certain sizes or larger.
So let's cut that line and create a media query and @mixin atSmall, and paste that value back in, then check in the browser if that does the trick, well it does. 


	.feature-item {
	position: relative;
	padding-bottom: 2.5rem;

	@mixin atSmall {
		padding-left: 94px;
	}


Now we need to tell small screens to stop positionning icons 'ABSOLUTELY'. 
So within the icon rule, let's cut both of these lines 'position: absolute' and 'left:0;' and create a @mixin atSmall, paste those lines back in, and check in the browser; Alright, it looks better now. 

	&__icon {
		
		@mixin atSmall {
			position: absolute;
			left: 0;
		}
	}



The Icon centered would look better though. So within the Baseline style of the '&__icon' rule, let's say 'display: block;' and 'margin: 0 auto;'

	&__icon {

		display: block;
		margin: 0 auto;
		
		@mixin atSmall {
			position: absolute;
			left: 0;
		}
	}

We check in the browser, perfect. Now we should reduce the font-size of our <h3> element, and also reduce its Top margin for small screens, so within our CSS file, let's look for the '&__title' rule for that element, then cut the font-size property and place it in a @mixin atSmall media query, and then set the baseline font-size to 1.6rem; instead and check in the browser; That looks better.

	&__title {
		font-size: 1.6rem;
		font-weight: 300;
		margin-bottom: .8rem;

		@mixin atSmall {
			font-size: 1.875rem;
		}

Now let's reduce the Top margin, just a tiny bit, so back in our CSS, and add to the '&__title', the property of 'margin-top: .7rem;' and within our @mixin atSmall let's reset it to 'margin-top: 1rem;' Check in the browser and indeed that looks much better.

	
	&__title {
		font-size: 1.6rem;
		font-weight: 300;
		margin-top: .7rem;
		margin-bottom: .8rem;

		@mixin atSmall {
			font-size: 1.875rem;
			margin-top: 1rem;
		}

Next why don't make all of those titles centered for small screens, but keep them left-aligned on larger screens? 
So within our '&__title' rule let's add as our baseline a 'text-align: center;' and within our @mixin a 'text-align: left;' and then check in the browser. Should look Nice!! 

Now the styling for this 'Our features' is complete for large and small screens. Let's change gear and talk about Git Branch Merging.
